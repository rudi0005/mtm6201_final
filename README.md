# mtm6201_final

This project was very difficult. I made my wireframes so incredibly complicated and full of content not knowing we'd have to code it all. I can admit, this is not my best work, but I am still proud of everything I've accomplished this semester. I never thought I would ever understand coding but I kind of do! I try my best to at least.
I faced many challenges, the biggest one being bootstrap. I managed to finally understand bootstrap grid, but adding libraries and playing around with the colours was very complicated to me. Since we just learned this material the last few weeks, it did not flow as well as I had wished. With that being said, I overcame this by doing some research and revisiting the class material.
During this project, I learned the importance of paying attention in class, staying up to date with the material, and most importantly, time management. It was very difficult managing how to use my time with this huge assignment, as there are still missing elements to it, but I will know how to use my time better in the future because of this.
